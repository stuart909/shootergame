This is a space shooter game that I made with my kids a couple of years ago to show them how video games are made.  They sat with me for most of the more interesting programming moments and my daughter made illustrations using PAINT.NET that I used in the project.  This game has a simple randomly generated starfield and randomly generates enemies in random patterns for the little space ship to shoot and blow up.  My kids lost interest in the project, so I did not put in things like score, lives, levels, or continues.  The game loop will run indefinitely until you turn it off.  Feel free to study this game and redistribute if you want to learn how simple space shooter games are made.
